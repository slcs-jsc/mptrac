# Summary

The MPTRAC Lagrangian transport model is designed to simulate the transport and dispersion of air parcels carrying pollutants, aerosols, and trace gases in the atmosphere. Unlike Eulerian models, which describe transport on a fixed spatial grid, MPTRAC follows individual air parcels along their trajectories, providing a detailed representation of atmospheric transport processes. This approach enables researchers to study the dispersion, long-range transport, and deposition of substances with high spatial and temporal resolution. By leveraging high-performance computing and advanced numerical techniques, MPTRAC provides an efficient and flexible platform for simulating atmospheric transport under diverse meteorological conditions.

# Statement of need

As global concerns over air quality and pollutant dispersion intensify, there is an urgent need for advanced tools to model the transport and behavior of particles in the atmosphere. Understanding how pollutants like aerosols, greenhouse gases, and hazardous materials move through the atmosphere is essential for assessing their impacts on climate, human health, and ecosystems. Traditional Eulerian models, which track air masses, often fail to capture the fine-scale details of particle movement.

The MPTRAC Lagrangian transport model fills this gap by simulating the movement of individual particles, providing a more accurate representation of their dispersion, deposition, and interaction with atmospheric conditions. MPTRAC has been instrumental in applications ranging from air quality forecasting to studying the impacts of volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and chemical spills. There is a clear need for a tool like MPTRAC to enhance environmental monitoring, inform climate research, and support emergency response efforts, ultimately improving public health and guiding policy decisions.

# Scientific background

Lagrangian transport models are widely used in atmospheric sciences to simulate the movement and dispersion of air parcels, aerosols, and trace gases. These models track the trajectories of individual particles as they move with atmospheric flow, providing a detailed representation of transport processes. Unlike Eulerian models, which describe the evolution of concentrations on a fixed spatial grid, Lagrangian models offer a more flexible approach by directly following air parcels, making them particularly useful for studying long-range transport, dispersion, and mixing in the atmosphere.

The physical basis of Lagrangian transport modeling relies on solving the equations of motion for individual particles, incorporating advection by large-scale wind fields, turbulent diffusion, gravitational settling, and various removal processes such as dry and wet deposition. These models can be driven by meteorological data from global or regional weather prediction systems, allowing for realistic simulations of atmospheric transport under different conditions. Applications range from tracking volcanic ash and wildfire smoke to studying the stratospheric circulation of greenhouse gases and pollutants. Ongoing advancements focus on improving the representation of turbulence, boundary layer processes, and computational efficiency, enabling more accurate and high-resolution simulations of atmospheric transport phenomena.

# Features

MPTRAC is a Lagrangian particle dispersion tool designed to analyze atmospheric transport processes in the free troposphere and stratosphere. It computes air parcel trajectories by solving the kinematic equation of motion, utilizing horizontal wind and vertical velocity fields from global reanalyses or forecasts. To account for mesoscale diffusion and subgrid-scale wind fluctuations, MPTRAC employs the Langevin equation, introducing stochastic perturbations to the trajectories. Additionally, it features an inter-parcel exchange module to represent air mixing.â€‹

The model includes modules for simulating convection, sedimentation, exponential decay, gas and aqueous phase chemistry, and both wet and dry deposition processes. Its meteorological data pre-processing capabilities provide estimates for boundary layers, convective available potential energy, geopotential heights, potential vorticity, and tropopause data. MPTRAC offers various output methods, including particle, grid, ensemble, profile, sample, and station data, and supports visualization through Gnuplot and ParaView interfaces. Designed for efficiency, it utilizes MPI-OpenMP-OpenACC hybrid parallelization and specific code optimizations, making it suitable for deployment on systems ranging from single workstations to high-performance computing (HPC) and GPU platforms. The model is distributed as open-source software under the GNU GPL license.

# Applications

The MPTRAC model has important applications in simulating the transport and dispersion of particles from natural events like volcanic eruptions and wildfires. During a volcanic eruption, ash plumes are ejected high into the atmosphere, and the model can track the movement of these particles as they are carried by wind currents across vast distances. MPTRAC helps in predicting the spread of volcanic ash, which can have significant impacts on air travel, climate, and ecosystems. Similarly, the model is used to simulate the transport of smoke and particulate matter from wildfires. As wildfires release large amounts of smoke and aerosols into the atmosphere, MPTRAC can simulate how these particles are dispersed, including their ascent into the upper atmosphere and eventual removal through deposition or precipitation. These applications are crucial for air quality monitoring, hazard assessment, and environmental impact studies related to both volcanic activity and wildfire events.

An example application of the MPTRAC Lagrangian transport model is in studying the transport of air parcels from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) into the free troposphere. The PBL, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, is characterized by turbulent mixing and direct interaction with the Earth's surface, which often leads to the accumulation of pollutants or aerosols. Using MPTRAC, researchers can track how these air parcels, once lifted by strong updrafts or convective currents, move into the more stable free troposphere. Once in the free troposphere, the air parcels are subject to less turbulent mixing, and the pollutants or aerosols they carry can be dispersed over large areas within a matter of days. The model simulates how these particles are transported, spread, and ultimately removed from the atmosphere through processes like deposition or precipitation, providing crucial insights into atmospheric circulation and pollutant distribution on regional to global scales.

# Development history and outlook

Development of the MPTRAC model began around 2013, with the code designed from scratch, allowing us to specifically target high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Initially, the model utilized OpenMP parallelization, allowing it to efficiently run on multi-core CPU systems. MPI parallelization was introduced to faciliatete large-scale ensemble simulations. In 2019, OpenACC offloading was introduced to enable execution on NVIDIA GPUs, significantly enhancing performance. Over time, all geophysical modules were ported to GPUs, ensuring that trajectory calculations are now fully offloaded, minimizing host-device data transfers and optimizing efficiency. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to improve software documentation for both users and developers, as well as to implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) methods for thorough code testing. Today, MPTRAC undergoes routine testing in GitHub Actions and is validated on three different HPC systems at JSC, including the development platform for the upcoming JUPITER Exascale machine, ensuring its reliability and scalability for cutting-edge atmospheric transport simulations.

While the HPC capabilities of MPTRAC are already highly advanced, future development will focus on expanding its applicability to a broader range of atmospheric transport simulations. A key objective is to enhance the realism of simulations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL), where turbulence and surface interactions play a crucial role in particle transport. To achieve this, we plan to implement the direct use of terrain-following coordinates from meteorological input data, improving the modelâ€™s representation of airflow over complex topography. Additionally, more advanced parametrizations of turbulence and diffusion in the PBL will be introduced, allowing for a more accurate depiction of small-scale transport processes. These improvements will extend MPTRACâ€™s capabilities beyond the free troposphere and stratosphere, making it an even more powerful tool for studying near-surface air quality, pollutant dispersion, and other environmental applications.
