## Predefined pressure levels

With the parameter ``` MET_PRESS_LEVEL_DEF ``` vertical pressure levels can be selected from a number of definitions. 
The definitions follow the [ECMWFs model level definitions](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/UDOC/Model+level+definitions). 
Per default, the value is set to -1 and hence ignored.

| MET_PRESS_LEVEL_DEF |  Name  | bottom  | top | nbr. of levels    |
| --------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0               |   L137  |  1044.45 hPa|0.02 hPa| 137    |
| 1               |   L91  |1044.45 hPa|0.02 hPa|  92   |
| 2               |   L60  |1044.45 hPa|0.01 hPa|   61  |
