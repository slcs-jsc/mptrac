# Meteorological input data

## Introduction

The MPTRAC model needs meteorological input data (winds, temperature,
...) to perform the trajectory calculations and for other tasks.

 The meteo data should be provided as netCDF files on a regular grid
 (pressure, longitude, latitude). Each time step of the reanalysis
 data should be provided as a separate netCDF file. The time step of
 the corresponding meteo data file is inferred from the filename
 following this naming convention:

```
     <basename>_<YYYY>_<MM>_<DD>_<HH>.nc
```

At a minimum, MPTRAC needs temperature (netCDF variable name: `T`),
zonal wind (`U`), and meridional wind (`V`). Additionally, many
applications need the vertical velocity (`W`), specific humidity (`Q`)
or relative humidity (`RH`), ozone (`O3`), cloud liquid/rain water
content (`CLWC`/`CRWC`), cloud ice/snow water content (`CIWC`/`CSWC`),
and cloud cover (`CC`).

It is also necessary to provide the surface pressure (`LNSP`, `PS`, or
`SP`) and the surface geopotential height (`Z` or `ZM`). Optionally,
the surface temperature (`T2M`), the surface wind components (`U10M`,
`V10M`), the land-sea mask (`LSM`), and sea surface temperature
(`SSTK`) are read in.

It is possible to provide meteo data on model levels rather than
pressure levels. In this case, pressure on model levels (`PL`) is
required as an additional 3-D input variable in order to perform a
vertical interpolation from model levels to pressure levels.

See the `tests/data/` directory in the MPTRAC repository for examples
of meteo data netCDF files used for MPTRAC.

## The ECMWF reanalyses

### Overview

As an example, we discuss the use of
[ERA-Interim](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era-interim)
and
[ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5)
reanalysis data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to run the MPTRAC model.

ERA-Interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis that is available from
1 January 1979 to 31 August 2019. The data assimilation system used to
produce ERA-Interim is based on a 2006 release of the IFS
(Cy31r2). The system includes a 4-dimensional variational analysis
(4D-Var) with a 12-hour analysis window. The spatial resolution of the
data set is approximately 80 km (T255 spectral grid) on 60 levels in
the vertical from the surface up to 0.1 hPa.

ERA5 provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land
and oceanic climate variables from 1950 to present. The data cover the
Earth on a 30 km grid (T639 triangular truncation) and resolve the
atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of about
80 km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables
at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.

### Download of ECMWF data

The first step is to download the ERA-Interim data from [ECMWF's data
archive](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily). It
is recommended to download the data in grib file format at 0.75°x0.75°
horizontal resolution, on all 60 model levels, and at 6-hourly time
intervals.

Alternatively, download ERA5 data from the
[Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Date Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/search?text=ERA5&type=dataset).
It is recommended to download the data in grib file format at 0.3°x0.3°
horizontal resolution, on all 137 model levels, and at hourly time
intervals.

### Interpolation to pressure levels

The second step is to interpolate the ERA-Interim data from model
levels to pressure levels. Here, a set of target pressure levels needs
to be selected. It is recommended to use a set of 60 pressure levels
that matches the vertical sampling of the model level data (as defined
by a fixed surface pressure of 1013.25 hPa and
[ECMWF's a and b level coefficients](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support/60-model-levels)).

For ERA5 a different set of [a and be level coefficients](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support/137-model-levels)
should be considered. Potentially, the vertical sampling of the target
pressure levels in the lower troposphere and the number of levels in
the mesosphere can be reduced to reduce the amount of data.

The [CDO tools](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo) can be used
to perform the vertical interpolation from model levels to pressure
levels and to convert from grib to netCDF file format. For example:

```
    # merge surface and model level grib files...
    cdo -P 8 merge 2020010100_sf.grb 2020010100_ml.grb merge.grib

    # interpolate to pressure levels and create netCDF file (for ERA-Interim)...

## Other meteorological data sets

The MPTRAC model can also be used with other meteorological data sets.

The [Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2)](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/)
provides data beginning in 1980. It was introduced to replace the
original MERRA dataset because of the advances made in the
assimilation system that enable the assimilation of modern
hyperspectral radiance and microwave observations, along with
GPS-Radio Occultation datasets. It also uses NASA's ozone profile
observations that began in late 2004. Additional advances in both the
GEOS model and the GSI assimilation system are included in
MERRA-2. The spatial resolution remains about the same (about 50 km in
the latitudinal direction) as in MERRA.

The [NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html)
project is using a state-of-the-art analysis/forecast system to
perform data assimilation using past data from 1948 to the present. A
large subset of this data is available from PSL in its original 4
times daily format and as daily averages. However, the data from
1948-1957 is a little different, in the regular (non-Gaussian) gridded
data. That data was done at 8 times daily in the model because the
inputs available in that era were available at 3Z, 9Z, 15Z, and 21Z,
whereas the 4x daily data has been available at 0Z, 6Z, 12Z, and
18Z. These latter times were forecasted and the combined result for
this early era is 8x daily. The local ingestion process took only the
0Z, 6Z, 12Z, and 18Z forecasted values, and thus only those were used
to make the daily time series and monthly means here.

The [Global Forecast System (GFS)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs)
is a weather forecast model produced by the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of atmospheric and land-soil
variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures,
winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone
concentration. The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base
horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid points,
which is used by the operational forecasters who predict weather out
to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops to 44 miles (70
kilometers) between grid points for forecasts between one week and two
weeks.

## Interoperability with CLaMS data 

MPTRAC can read meteorological data that follows the data format
guidelines for the CLaMS Lagrangian transport model.  See the page on
[diabatic transport](diabatic-transport.md) for further details.

## MeteoCloud data archive in Jülich

For registered users and collaboration partners at the Jülich
Supercomputing Centre, Germany, a number of meteorological data sets
are readily available for MPTRAC in netCDF file format. The data sets
are stored in the
[MeteoCloud data archive](https://datapub.fz-juelich.de/slcs/meteocloud)
in Jülich. Please contact us in order to inquire about getting access
to the data.
